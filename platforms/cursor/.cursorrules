# Superpowers for Cursor

You have access to a comprehensive skills library in the `skills/` directory.

## Available Skills

To use a skill, read it from the `skills/` directory and follow its instructions exactly.

**Testing Skills:**
- `test-driven-development` - Write tests first, watch them fail, implement
- `testing-anti-patterns` - Avoid testing mocks instead of behavior
- `condition-based-waiting` - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling

**Debugging Skills:**
- `systematic-debugging` - Four-phase framework: investigate, analyze, hypothesize, implement
- `root-cause-tracing` - Trace bugs backward to find original trigger
- `verification-before-completion` - Run verification before claiming success

**Collaboration Skills:**
- `brainstorming` - Refine rough ideas through Socratic method
- `writing-plans` - Create detailed implementation plans
- `requesting-code-review` - Process for requesting reviews
- `receiving-code-review` - Process for receiving reviews

**Development Skills:**
- `using-git-worktrees` - Create isolated workspaces for feature work
- `subagent-driven-development` - Dispatch subagents for independent tasks

## Usage Pattern

1. When user requests work, check if a skill applies
2. Read the relevant skill: `skills/[skill-name].md`
3. Follow the skill's instructions exactly
4. For multi-step work, use the writing-plans skill first

## Parallel Development

If working with multiple developers or sessions:
- Use git line-staging: `git stage-lines <file> <line-numbers>`
- Use concurrent-safe code review patterns (see `docs/concurrent-code-review.md`)

## Critical Rules

- **Use skills when they apply** - Don't skip them
- **Test-driven development** - Tests before implementation
- **Verify before claiming completion** - Run verification commands
- **Evidence over claims** - Show output, don't just say "it works"
